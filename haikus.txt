summer grasses
all that remains
of warriors dreams

The autumn moon is bright;
Sea-waves whirl up to my gate,
Crested silvery white

scent of plum blossoms
on the misty mountain path
a big rising sun

None is travelling
Here along this way but I,
This autumn evening

Temple bells die out.
The fragrant blossoms remain.
A perfect evening!

From all directions
Winds bring petals of cherry
Into the grebe lake

Wrapping dumplings in 
bamboo leaves, with one finger 
she tidies her hair 

With dewdrops dripping, 
I wish somehow I could wash 
this perishing world 

overhanging pine...
adding its mite of needles
to the waterfall

A lovely spring night 
suddenly vanished while we 
viewed cherry blossoms

The temple bell stops.
But the sound keeps coming
out of the flowers

Searching storehouse eaves, 
rapt in plum blossom smells, 
the mosquito hums 

Wet with morning dew
and splotched with mud, the melon
looks especially cool

Sick on my journey,
only my dreams will wander
these desolate moors

Alone, in old
clothes, sipping wine
Beneath the moon

Morning sun -
The purple petals,
Four have fallen

Early morning gentle rain,
two big bumblebees
Humming at their work

The little worm
lowers itself from the roof
By a self shat thread

Bluejay drinking at my
saucer of milk,
Throwing his head back

Men and women
Yakking beneath
the eternal void

I went in the woods
to meditate -
It was too cold

The sound of silence
is all the instruction
You'll get
